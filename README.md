# Quick-functions

During my PhD, I found not satisfied with some basic R functions. Therefore, I try to create some simple functions to conduct multiple analysis by simply using one function, to speed the coding and reduce the redundant code.

Below are discriptions of these R scripts.

**Abboxplot.R**:            To visualize the alpha and beta diversity of a given matrix by function boxplot().

**Boxplot.grp.R**:          To draw boxplot by just input the data list and levels of a group factor.

**Element.grp.R**:          To find out how many levels of a group.

**Left.R**:                 To take the number of letters from the left of the string.

**Mean.SE.R**:              To calculate the mean and se of a matrix.

**Mean.SE.grp.R**:          Based on the function *Mean.SE()* and *Element.grp()*, To calculate the mean and se of a matrix based on a grp factor.

**Reorder.R**:              To reorder a matrix by its column.

**Replace.R**:              To replace the elements in a vector with another vector with the same number.

**Wilcox.test.grp.R**:      To perform function Wilcox.test() on variables among at least 3 groups.
