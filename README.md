# Quick-functions

During my PhD, I found not satisfied with some basic R functions. Therefore, I try to create some simple functions to conduct multiple analysis by simply using one function, to speed the coding and reduce the redundant code.

Below are discriptions of these R scripts.

1, Mean.SE.R: to calculate the mean and se of a matrix.
2, Element.grp.R: To find out how many levels of a group.
3, Wilcox.test.grp.R: To proform function Wilcox.test() on variables among at least 3 groups.
